  |   During a long-passed archaeological excavation, a set of Gates were   |
  |   discovered. People quickly realized that these ancient passages       |
  |   lead to different realms and dimensions - providing brave and         |
  |   reckless adventurers with treasures beyond measure. Rynoka, a small   |
  |   commercial village, was founded near the excavation site providing    |
  |   refuge and a place for adventurers to sell their hard-earned          |
  |   riches.                                                               |
